# Orchestrating-AI-Agents---MCP
This project implements an AI-powered debate system where two autonomous agents engage in a structured debate on the topic of Universal Basic Income (UBI). The system uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to facilitate communication between the agents, ensuring a clear and organized exchange of arguments.
